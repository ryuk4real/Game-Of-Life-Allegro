# About
---
This repository, as you can guess by its name, is a reproduction of the famous [Conay's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It's implemented in C++ with the Allegro5 graphic library.

## Customization
Use the [json file](https://github.com/ryuk4real/Game-Of-Life-Allegro/blob/main/src/settings/settings.json) for chaning the color of dead/alive cells, grid and windows size, etc.
